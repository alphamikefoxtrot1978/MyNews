Kathy Hochul\u2019s bid to expand the involuntary commitment laws is facing some resistance in the legislature.\n\u201cDo you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose expanding the state eligibility standard for involuntary treatment and care to include individuals who are unable to care for themselves and meet their basic needs?\u201d the survey asked.\nOf the 600 voters polled only 4% said they were opposed\u00a0and 8% were undecided as support for change was overwhelming in all parts of the city and demographic groups.\nMore than nine in 10 voters (91%) also agreed with the statement that \u201cit is more compassionate to provide involuntary treatment and care for people with severe mental illness than it is to leave them on the streets\u201d \u2014 including a majority (53%) who strongly agree with that statement.\nSimilarly, 91% of voters agree that \u201cpeople struggling with severe mental illness should not be denied life-saving psychiatric care because their illness prevents them from recognizing that they need help\u201d \u2014 including 59% who strongly agree.\nThe poll \u2014 conducted by Tulchin Research\u00a0for ABNY \u2014 also found that 73% of voters said that the number of public safety incidents in New York involving individuals with untreated severe mental illness has increased in recent years. Some 18% said the number has stayed the same, and just 4% said it has decreased.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are rightfully concerned about their safety,\u201d said Steven Rubenstein, chairman of ABNY. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just from watching the news. It is rooted in the firsthand experiences that New Yorkers are having in the transit system every single day.\n\u201cThere is an overwhelming consensus spanning every borough and every political party that we have a problem and there are compassionate ways to fix it,\u201d Rubenstein added. \u201cThe proposed laws to better care for people who cannot care for themselves have the solid support of New Yorkers.\u201d\nSome 86% of Big Apple residents said they\u2019ve seen a person wandering on the street or in the subway\u00a0who appears to be struggling with severe mental illness and unable to care for themselves.\nAbout nine in 10 voters believe it should be a top or high priority of New York State lawmakers to address untreated severe mental illness, the poll showed.\nNearly-two thirds of respondents said they have felt endangered while riding the subway or bus due to the actions of someone grappling with severe mental illness.\nA Hochul rep said she and the voters are in sync on wanting common sense solutions to help mentally ill residents get care while bolstering public safety. \n\u201cProviding care to people facing significant health risks due to mental illness is a compassionate and humane approach that all New Yorkers can recognize. This is why there is overwhelming public support for Governor Hochul\u2019s proposal,\u201d spokesperson Avery Cohen said.\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the Legislature to enact these statutory changes and align New York with 43 other states that already have this in their laws. The cost of inaction is far too high.\u201d\nIn its analysis, Tulchin Research said voters widely see involuntary care as \u201ccompassionate and necessary\u201d to help those who can\u2019t help themselves and believe that expanding the eligibility standard for involuntary care also protects public safety.\nDespite overwhelming public support, Hochul is facing some headwinds in Albany.\nThe state Assembly and Senate either entirely omitted or scrapped parts of Hochul\u2019s bid to expand involuntary commitment laws in separate counter proposals to the governor\u2019s budget plan released last week.\nThe lower chamber\u2019s one-house budget proposal omits Hochul\u2019s proposal around expanding the necessary criteria to compel mentally ill people into psychiatric care.\nBut it includes provisions for strengthening hospital discharge planning and requiring review panels after serious incidents where mentally ill people fall through the cracks or harm others.\nMany mental health care advocates and civil activists also oppose forced treatment, but others including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said there could be room for acceptable compromise.\n\u201cWe want people to feel safe on the subways. Subways should not become temporary living places for people who have mental health issues,\u201d Heastie said last week.\nTulchin Research conducted the ABNY survey among 600 voters in New York City from Feb. 4-10.

On government cuts, 47% said his changes were good, compared to just 29% who opposed.\nEven on his handling of the Ukraine war and NATO \u2014 policies he\u2019s received significant pushback on \u2014 more respondents said his actions were good \u2014 (41% and 40%) than opposed his actions.\nNBC poll respondents also appear to be cutting Trump some slack on inflation \u2014 40% said his policies are having a positive effect, compared to 30% who said they were having a negative impact; 28% said Trump\u2019s policies are not changing things at all.\nIllustrating how the president remains a political Rorschach test for a deeply divided country, Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is 90%, while his figures among Democrats clock in at a paltry 4%, per the poll.\nThat\u2019s the largest gap in approval ratings between a president\u2019s party and the opposition party over the last 80 years, NBC assessed.\nSome 47% of voters in the survey approve of Trump \u2014 compared to 51% who disapprove, marking an all-time high in the poll. He previously hit 47% in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2018. \nNBC News\u2019 findings mirror most other polling, with the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls showing Trump with a 48.2% approval rating on average.\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is significantly higher than where it stood at this point during his first term (44%), per RCP, though below where former President Joe Biden was during the same time (53%). \nIn another boost for Trump, NBC News recorded that a two-decade high 44% of registered voters believe that the country is on the right track, while 54% believe it\u2019s heading in the wrong direction. \nWhile still pessimistic, that marks the most positive outlook on the country\u2019s direction the poll has found since President George W. Bush was in office 20 years ago.\nIt\u2019s also a huge swing from the last administration. Last September, just 28% percent of polled voters told NBC News that the country was headed in the right direction \u2014 compared to 65% who said it was on the wrong track.\nOne of the most significant actions Trump has taken in his second term was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), something that has sparked protests from government workers and an outcry from Democrats. \nWhile DOGE is unpopular (47% negative to 41% positive), voters generally believe it was a good idea (46%), compared to 40% who say it was a bad idea to set up. \nTrump has steadfastly stood by DOGE and Elon Musk amid political backlash to the cost-cutting initiative, which is intended to help slim down the federal deficit. \nIn a key bright spot for Trump, Democrats\u2019 favorability is at an abysmal 27%, with 55% viewing the party negatively, marking the worst numbers for the party in NBC News\u2019 polling history.\nAnother poll from CNN found a similar result and also pegged Dems with their lowest rating in its polling history, with only 29% viewing the party favorably.\nAdditionally, voters also displayed skepticism of the media\u2019s coverage of Trump, with 46% concluding it\u2019s been too critical, while 25% felt it was too supportive, and 24% approved of the media\u2019s approach to him.\nThe NBC News survey sampled 1,000 registered voters between March 7\u201311 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Tests for influenza and RSV were negative, but he wasn\u2019t tested for COVID.\n\u201cAlthough the patient himself didn\u2019t travel, he had exposure to travelers. \u2026 I was voted down and the patient wasn\u2019t tested, well, not until several months later,\u201d Weiss said.\nIt turned out that the ride-share driver had COVID. He had underlying ailments and died from COVID-related issues in May 2021.\nNearly 240 suspected COVID-19 cases were reported to the city\u2019s Health Department before the first COVID case was confirmed March 1, 2020.\n\u201cCOVID-19 was clearly circulating in NYC a month before the first recognized positive case,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cThe delay in testing capacity resulted in delayed recognition of \u00a0the circular virus, which impaired the public health response until well after community transmission was established.\u201d\nWeiss, in a subsequent interview with\u00a0The Post about his book, said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility we would have saved lives\u201d if COVID transmission had been detected sooner.\nAt the very least, residents could have been warned to quarantine and wear masks to\u00a0protect themselves and others, he said.\nNeither the CDC nor New York City Health Department responded to The Post\u2019s requests for comment.\nWeiss was enraged when de Blasio mentioned a child in The Bronx who tested positive for COVID-19 \u2013revealing enough information that the kid was identified.\n\u201cThe child became the target of abuse from classmates and the community. \u2026 We were outraged and vowed not to share any more information that could repeat the cruelty we witnessed,\u201d Weiss wrote.\nHe told\u00a0The Post that city Health Department staffers actually donated money to the student.\n\u201cContact tracing in NYC was ineffective at slowing transmission of COVID-19. Anyone who claims differently is putting lipstick on a pig,\u201d Weiss said.\nHe said the screening of students at school for COVID-19 was also overused.\nIt\u2019s fair to argue that it was appropriate to try different strategies to help tame a once-in-a-century pandemic, Weiss said.\n\u201cBut the tenacity with which the city stuck with ineffective strategies can\u2019t be justified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to move toward a more tolerable balance of individual freedom and community protection.\u201d\nData show 46,879 deaths in the city have been associated with COVID-19 and its variants since the original outbreak.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote a letter to Villarreal last year informing him of some of the astounding whistleblower testimonies that have been submitted to his office documenting \u201cpossible child-trafficking rings\u201d among those sponsors.\nOne of the whistleblowers revealed that a migrant child had been shuttled to a house with \u201clikely MS-13\u201d gang-affiliated members.\nSouthwest Key only produced \u201clazy and obstructive\u201d responses to records requests, according to another letter Grassley fired off on Monday.\nTrump\u2019s DOJ withdrew from its civil case against Southwest Key on Wednesday, however, and HHS announced in a statement Wednesday that it will no longer fund the Texas nonprofit.\n\u201cOut of continuing concerns relating to these placements, HHS has decided to stop placement of unaccompanied alien children in Southwest Key facilities, and to review its grants with the organization,\u201d noted the public health agency, which coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security to handle the influx of migrant children.\n\u201cIn view of HHS\u2019 action, the Department of Justice has dismissed its lawsuit against Southwest Key.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Southwest Key Programs said in a statement Wednesday that the group was \u201cpleased\u201d about the case\u2019s dismissal and \u201cstrongly denied the claims relating to child sexual abuse in our shelters.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no settlement or payment required,\u201d the spokesperson added, before blaming a Trump admin-imposed government funding freeze for 5,000 layoffs.\nA spokeswoman for Grassley told The Post Friday: \u201cIt is disgusting that vulnerable children suffered sexual abuse under Southwest Key\u2019s watch. Senator Grassley has contacted the DOJ seeking clarity regarding its dismissal of the Southwest Key lawsuit, and looks forward to a follow-up conversation soon.\u201d\nAccording to an August 2024 report from DHS\u2019 inspector general, at least 32,000 migrant kids went missing in the US after being released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which coordinated with HHS on sponsor placement in the US.\nAnother 291,000 were released to the domestic sponsors, not all of whom were properly vetted after DHS and HHS reached an agreement to no longer require \u201cbiographic and biometric (fingerprints) information for all potential sponsors and adult members of their household,\u201d the report found.\nAs border crossings climbed in 2022, Biden\u2019s HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra had also been pressuring staff to release migrant children to sponsors as quickly as possible, likening the ideal turnover rate to an \u201cassembly line,\u201d The New York Times reported.\n\u201cThis administration is working fearlessly to end the tragedy of human trafficking and other abuses of unaccompanied alien children who enter the country illegally,\u201d HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said of the termination of Southwest Key Programs grants on Wednesday.\n\u201cFor too long, pernicious actors have exploited such children both before and after they enter the United States.

Republicans in general, are faring much better, with a 36% favorability rating, the CNN poll found.\nMost Dem voters believe that top party brass is steering Democrats in the wrong direction, CNN found.\nAnd now it\u2019s spilling over \u2014 with congressional Democrats openly sniping at Schumer over his decision.\n\u201cThe idea that Chuck Schumer is the only one that\u2019s got a brain in the room and the only one that can think through all of the pros and cons is absolutely ridiculous,\u201d Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) fumed on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday.\nModerate and progressive Democratic lawmakers alike felt that the government shutdown fight was the only major leverage against Republicans that they would have for months.\nPresident Trump, who enjoys unprecedented executive power along with majorities in both chambers of Congress, has run roughshod over the Democrats with a flurry of executive activity in his first 50 days in office.\nCritics of Schumer\u2019s decision wanted to use that fight to extract concessions from the GOP on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the spending cuts that Republicans are planning.\nSchumer, however \u2014 along with nine other Democrats \u2014 declined to block the GOP bill, saying they believed that allowing the government to shut down would be a loser for the party.\nProgressive activists erupted in outrage, and groups such as Indivisible promptly called on Senate Dems to oust the New Yorker from his longtime post.\nA Change.org petition to cease donations to the Dems until Schumer steps down quickly garnered over 21,000 signatures. \n\u201cThey blew it! The Democratic Tea Party was born the same day that Chuck Schumer took to that podium to read that very well-crafted statement that told us he folded like a paper napkin,\u201d Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former Harris-aide, turned MSNBC host chided Saturday.\nDemocratic leadership appears to be splintering over the party\u2019s direction as well.\nIn a stunning rebuke from a fellow Brooklyn native, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) refused to say whether he had confidence in his Senate counterpart or whether Schumer should be replaced, illustrating the palpable level of frustration among Dems.\n\u201cNext question,\u201d Jeffries said during a press conference when asked about Schumer\u2019s future as leader of the Senate Dems. \nSo far, Democratic lawmakers have steered clear of publicly calling for Schumer to be booted as the No. 1 Senate Dem, though murmurs about his future have spread in private, according to Politico.\n\u201cI think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there\u2019s a wide sense of betrayal if things proceed as currently planned,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has been pressured by some progressives to mount a primary challenge against Schumer, told NewsNation last week\nOther Senate Democrats have not been shy about ripping into Schumer\u2019s approach to the shutdown scrum, either.\n\u201cAmericans want the Democratic Party to stand up and fight and to take risks,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press \u201d on Sunday. \u201cIf we continue to work with Republicans, if we continue to hand Donald Trump more power, we are going to lose our democracy.\u201d\nPolling echoes Murphy\u2019s point, with some 57% of Democrats and aligned Independents wanting the party to focus on countering the GOP agenda instead of partnering with Republicans on bipartisan proposals, according to the CNN survey. \nThat\u2019s a sharp turnaround from eight years ago, when 74% of Democratic-leaning voters wanted the party to focus on bipartisanship with Republicans rather than focus on fighting the GOP, per the CNN poll. \nSignificantly, that poll came before Schumer and nine other Democrats refrained from blocking the GOP bill to forestall a partial government shutdown. \nSchumer has shrugged off the backlash. Having spent over a quarter century in the Senate and nearly two decades in the House, he\u2019s lived through multiple government shutdowns and did not feel his party was positioned to win this one.\n\u201cIt would be a disaster,\u201d Schumer had warned about a partial shutdown. \u201cAnd we have to alert everyone how much pain it would cause the American people.\u201d\nTrump and Republicans have sought to put salt in Schumer\u2019s wounds by publicly lauding his efforts to avert a shutdown, knowing full well how progressives will interpret that.\n\u201cAOC has a lot to learn from Chuck Schumer. He did the right thing for America and New York,\u201d White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer needled about the Democratic infighting. \nConsternation about Democratic leadership goes deeper than the shutdown row. \nSince Trump\u2019s return to the White House, Democrats have struggled to navigate his return, with disputes between moderates and progressives over how to calibrate messaging and whether the party should lurch towards the center.\nThis past month, for example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) stoked controversy by suggesting that transgender competition in women\u2019s sports is unfair, rankling elements of his base.\nThe CNN poll sampled 1,206 adults between March 6\u20139 and was taken by SSRS with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.

Andrew Cuomo used heavy-handed tactics and secretiveness with Big Apple officials as the city struggled to contain the deadly COVID pandemic, a scathing new study says.\nEx-Mayor Bill de Blasio also gets dinged in the report, which was issued by several city agencies that analyzed New York City\u2019s handling of the health crisis \u2014 and which specifically criticized the toxic\u00a0relationship between\u00a0him and Cuomo.\n\u201cCoordination challenges between Governor Cuomo\u2019s and Mayor de Blasio\u2019s administrations impeded City-State collaboration and contributed to duplicative work, inconsistent recommendations, and a loss of trust from New Yorkers,\u201d says the COVID-19 Response Review Report\u00a0covering January 2020 to July 2022 and obtained by The Post.\nThe analysis was prepared by city agencies \u2014 notably the Health Department, Office of Emergency Management and Health+Hospitals \u2014 serving under Cuomo\u2019s now-mayoral foe, Hizzoner Eric Adams.\nCuomo was accused in the report of big-footing City Hall and unnecessarily micro-managing the city\u2019s response.\n\u201cThe Cuomo administration was reluctant to share data with the City and often refused to give advance warning of policy changes and new directives,\u201d the study said.\nFor example, in March 2020, the state restricted the city\u2019s access to its Health Emergency Response Data System (HERDS), which tracks hospital capacity across New York state, though the city historically had regular access.\n\u201cThis limited the City\u2019s insight into hospital impacts and hindered its ability to support the NYC healthcare system,\u201d the report said.\nDon Weiss, the former longtime \u201csurveillance director\u201d for the city Health Department, said state Health Department officials he worked with for years told him they weren\u2019t supposed to share information.\n\u201cIt was because of the pissing contest between Cuomo and de Blasio. It was ludicrous,\u201d he said.\nA former state official said Cuomo\u2019s \u201cstrong dislike\u201d of de Blasio certainly was an issue but that officials in Albany and City Hall still found \u201ccreative ways\u201d to quietly work together despite the chill between the two power brokers.\nState officials were also \u201cslow to release critical pandemic-related guidance,\u201d the report said \u2014 resulting in the city either releasing its own guidance or policy which would later be superseded by the state.\nThe confusion \u201csignificantly impacted healthcare operations early in the pandemic,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\nThe disharmony spilled over into the crucial COVID-19 vaccine distribution period, the findings said.\nThe city obtained its COVID-19 vaccine supply directly from the federal Centers for Disease Control, as it had other vaccines.\nBut unlike previous vaccine campaigns, state approval was required for the city\u2019s vaccine allocation and the Big Apple\u2019s distribution plan each week, which \u201ccreated an additional bureaucratic layer,\u201d the report said.\nA former state official who requested anonymity said Albany \u201cmicro-managed\u201d the city\u2019s vaccination program.\u00a0\nThe study also pointed to \u201cstate and city guidance contradictions\u201d as creating serious issues.\nDe Blasio publicly announced plans to close schools and non-essential businesses because of a COVID-19 surge in parts of Brooklyn and Queens in October 2020.\nBut Cuomo, who had the authority to impose such measures, rejected the mayor\u2019s plan and announced his own geographical areas and closures for the city to enforce, the report said.\nBronx state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, chairman of the New York Senate\u2019s Health Committee, said Cuomo\u2019s \u201cbig-footing everybody\u201d was one of the reasons he voted against legislation giving the governor emergency powers without reporting back to the legislature.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an abusive bully,\u201d said Rivera, a Democrat along with Cuomo and Adams.\nCuomo defended his oversight of the pandemic in the city as governor.\n\u201cFeeble attempts to rewrite history now \u2014 five years later \u2014 in the midst of a political campaign are as ineffective as they are disingenuous,\u201d the former governor\u2019s spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, told The Post. \u201cNew Yorkers know what happened because they were there with us every step of the way.\n\u201cDecisions were made and communicated in real time as the facts on the ground kept changing and lines of communication with local governments, including the city, were open to the largest extent practical.\u201d\nThe Cuomo rep said a strong state presence was needed to aid the city.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s forgotten here is that the entire reason a uniform hospital system was set up in the first place was because Elmhurst, a city-run hospital, nearly collapsed and there was no plan from the city to redirect patients,\u201d Azzopardi said.\n\u201cThe city needed a manager then, and it does now. This was a once-in-a century pandemic and one would think any objective retrospective would be devoid of politics or political campaigns.\u201d\nBut Gustavo also claimed Cuomo blocked vaccine clinics from opening his district to spite him, potentially triggering more deaths from COVID-19.\nThe Cuomo campaign fired back with a list of five vaccination sites in the northwest Bronx in 2021.\n\u201cGustavo is a liar.

She\u2019ll have her paycheck, though.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez told reporters Thursday that many Democrats felt a \u201cdeep sense of outrage and betrayal\u201d over Senate Democratic Minority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer\u2019s announcement that he\u2019ll vote to advance the House-passed funding plan.\n\u201cWhile the bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,\u201d Schumer declared in a Senate floor speech Thursday. \u201cAllowing Trump to take even much more power is a far worse option.\u201d\nMany furious Democrats are now pushing Ocasio-Cortez to primary Schumer in response to his decision.", "link": "https://nypost.com/2025/03/15/us-news/fetterman-rips-aoc-for-criticizing-dems-backing-billl-to-avoid-government-shutdown/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2F2025%2F03%2Fsen-john-fetterman-d-pa-100522044.jpg?w%3D1024"}, {"title": "Fed judge orders deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gangbangers to return to US, blocks Trump from invoking Alien Enemies Act", "summary": "It comes as Trump made efforts late Saturday to expand the use of the order to deport migrant gang members nationwide.", "fullstory": "A federal judge temporarily blocked President Trump on Saturday from invoking the 18th century Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a hearing \u2013 ordering any flights carrying the supposed criminals to turn around.\nUS District judge James Boasberg quickly ordered the Trump administration to halt all removals after the commander in chief signed off on a presidential action invoking the 1798 law \u2013 aimed at targeting Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua, The Washington Post reported.\nThe chief judge in the District of Columbia said he heard that \u201cflights are actively departing\u201d and\u00a0directed\u00a0US officials to have planes in the air carrying migrants returned to the United States, the outlet reported.\n\u201cAny plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States however that is accomplished,\u201d Boasberg reportedly wrote. \nThe temporary ruling will put a 14-day restraining order on use of the wartime act, which the Trump administration hopes to use to deport any migrant it identifies as a gang member without following normal criminal and immigration channels.\u00a0\nA new hearing has been scheduled for Friday as a pause will be put in place for those deported under\u00a0the Alien Enemies Act.\n\u201cI do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,\u201d Boasber said during a hearing Saturday night.\u00a0\n\u201cA brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,\u201d he said, noting that the detainees will remain in government custody.\u00a0\nBoasberg\u2019s ruling came in response to\u00a0a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward challenging the removal of five Venezuelan men under the centuries-old law \u2014 which was reportedly signed on Friday.\nBefore the early evening ruling blocking the use of the act, an emergency hearing was held Saturday morning. At it the judge barred the removal of the five migrants named in the legal challenge, which Trump\u2019s administration has already appealed.\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in American history, all during wartime. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the last president to do so following the attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base, dragging the US into World War II.\nThe act was used by the Democrat\u2019s administration to\u00a0justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent.\nTrump\u2019s proclamation\u2019s language, however, contends the gang is effectively at war with the United States and Venezuelan nationals are now \u201cliable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\u201d\n\u201cOver the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement reads.\u00a0\n\u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of a predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.\u201d\nTren de Aragua\u2019s origins can be traced back to a Venezuelan prison.\u00a0\nThe violent gang\u2019s members are said to have blended in with the millions of Venezuelans who\u2019ve exited the South American nation over the last decade, hoping to start anew in America.\nTrump has highlighted the gang\u2019s crimes as validation for his push seeking tighter borders.\nThe White House said\u00a0300 people in US custody\u00a0have been identified as members of the gang, and could soon be deported to El Salvador.\nTrump signed a presidential order in January, designating Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, clearing a path for immigration officials to start rounding up its members for removal.", "link": "https://nypost.com/2025/03/15/us-news/fed-judge-orders-deportation-flights-carrying-alleged-venezuelan-gangbangers-to-return-to-us-after-trump-invokes-alien-enemies-act/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2F2025%2F03%2F2023-boasberg-starts-seven-year-100519440_f3574e.jpg?w%3D1024"}]
